    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals (Amber, Slate) with priority-based accents (Red, Orange, Yellow, Gray) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page dashboard with five main tabs for each subject area. Content within each subject is organized into collapsible accordion sections corresponding to the priority tiers (1-4). This structure avoids overwhelming the user with information, allowing them to focus on one subject and priority level at a time. The interactive tabs and accordions provide a more engaging and user-directed study experience than a static document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The core report content (topics, tiers) is organized textually. Priority is visualized using colored tags for quick identification. Interactivity is provided through JS-powered tabs and accordions. No traditional charts (e.g., bar, pie) are necessary as the data is qualitative and hierarchical. This approach directly serves the goal of creating a structured, explorable study guide. CONFIRMATION: NO SVG/Mermaid. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
